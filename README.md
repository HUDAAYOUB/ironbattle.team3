We've developed a program to simulate a video game featuring a battle between a Warrior and a Wizard. The program is composed of 4 classes and 1 Interface.
Main Class: It starts by prompting the user for names of the Warrior and Wizard. Characters are created for them, each possessing unique skills and strengths. The battle begins with the characters taking turns attacking each other, determined randomly. After each attack, we evaluate the battle status, and if one character has lost, a brief pause is taken before resuming the conflict. The user-input tool for obtaining names is then closed to complete the process.
Character Class and Inheritance: The parent Character class is an abstract representation of video game characters, with attributes like id, name, hp (hit points), and a boolean 'isAlive' indicating if the character is still in the game. It contains constructors to initialize the character's properties and methods to get and set id, name, hp, and check if the character is alive.
Sub Classes:
Warrior Class: In a role-playing game, the Warrior extends the Character class and implements the IAttack interface. It includes private traits like strength and endurance. The class has constructors accepting either integer or string values for stamina and strength. The attack method calculates the damage inflicted based on the warrior's endurance and strength, resulting in a 'Heavy Attack' or 'Weak Attack' and reducing the target's health accordingly.
Wizard Class: Representing a wizard character, this class extends the Character class and implements the IAttack interface. It has attributes like mana (magical energy) and intelligence (magical power). The attack method calculates the attack damage based on the wizard's mana and intelligence, launching either a 'Fireball' or 'Staff Hit' attack. The target's health is reduced accordingly.
Interface:
Attack Interface: This interface defines two methods: attack() and attack(Character target). Both Warrior and Wizard classes implement this interface, requiring subclasses of Character to provide their own implementations of attack().
In summary, the program simulates a video game battle between a Warrior and a Wizard, each having unique abilities and engaging in turn-based combat. The Character class acts as a blueprint for creating characters with specific traits and attack abilities.
